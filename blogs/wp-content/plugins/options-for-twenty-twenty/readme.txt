The Twenty Twenty theme does not use jQuery, we use pure JavaScript on the front end of this plugin so it doesn't need to enqueue jQuery.

This plugin makes use of hooks instead of custom templates which means it will work even after new versions of Twenty Twenty are published by the theme developers without breaking the theme :)

== Installation ==

Easily use this plugin to modify WordPress default Twenty Twenty theme ...

1) Install "Options for Twenty Twenty" automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
2) Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3) Find the additional features by clicking "Customize" in the "Appearance" admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I change the fonts? =

Changing fonts in a WordPress theme is not a customisation that is limited to Twenty Twenty. There are lots of plugins out there that already perform this task. We use [TK Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tk-google-fonts/ "TK Google Fonts") for example.
